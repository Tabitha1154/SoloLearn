               Hello! I am <strong>Tabitha</strong>. One day I wanna live on a farm with my kiddos and the love of my life. I want us to be able to grow our nutrient dense organic food that lets our kiddos <strong>thrive</strong>. Food is a very important aspect of my life. I do not want to put processed crap into my body nor my kiddos bodies. I want the absolute best for them even if it is interpreted to be <i>"bad"</i> by society's standards. I have no desire to go with the grain. If anything, I have a very strong desire to go <strong>against the grain</strong>.
