               Hello! I am <strong>Tabitha</strong>. I am just starting to learn to code. HTML was my starting point. I am not very good yet but plan to keep at it and learn more in the near future. Coding is very interesting and you can learn so much from it. It helps me give my mind something to do that could be actually useful in the future. One day I wanna be really good at coding and teach my kiddos about coding.
